Our statement of the Black Hole Area Theorem comes from \cite{wald2010general} (theorem \(12.2.6\)):
%todo: restate the tehorem only using \mathscr{H}, non serve distinguere tra 1 e 2 secondo me.
\begin{theorem}[Black Hole Area Theorem]
	Let \((M, g_{\mu\nu})\) be a strongly asymptotically predictable spacetime satisfying \(R_{\mu\nu}k^{\mu}k^{\nu} \ge 0\) for all null vectors \(k^{\mu}\) (\emph{null convergence condition}). Let \(\Sigma_1\) and \(\Sigma_2\) be spacelike Cauchy surfaces for the globally hyperbolic region \(\tilde{V}\) such that \(\Sigma_2 \subset I^+(\Sigma_1)\), and given \(H\) the event horizon we define
	\[
	\mathscr{H}_1 = H \cap \Sigma_1 \quad \quad \mathscr{H}_2 = H \cap \Sigma_2
	\]
	Then the area of \(\mathcal{H}_2\) is greater or equal than the area of \(\mathcal{H}_1\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	This theorem is usually proven by showing, through a reductio ab absurdum, that the expansion \(\theta\) of the null geodesic generators is everywhere non-negative. Here we wish to follow an alternative path, inspired by the index form methods, that makes use of another object, defined in section \ref{sec:submanifolds}: the mean curvature.
	
	As we have seen the equivalence between the \(2\) definitions of trapped surfaces, %todo: write it down and reference
	using a similar reasoning as for lemma \ref{lemma:charact-trapped}, we can see that the thesis is equivalent to proving that, for all \(p \in H\) and it exists a future-directed null (or, equivalently, causal) vector \(v^{\mu}\) in \(T_pH^{\perp}\):
	\[
	\mathfrak{H}^{\mu}(p)v_{\mu} \ge 0.
	\]
	Conversely, suppose that \(\exists p\in H\) such that \(\forall v^{\mu} \in T_pH^{\perp}\), with \(v^{\mu} \) future directed casusal vector, such that \(\mathfrak{H}^{\mu}(p)v_{\mu} < 0.\) Then, by \ref{lemma:charact-trapped} we know that \(\mathfrak{H}^{\mu}(p)\) is past-pointing timelike.
	
	We can now proceed as usual, following for example \cite{wald2010general}. Take the Cauchy surface \(\Sigma\) for the unphysical spacetime \(\tilde{V}\), that passes through \(p\), and define \(\mathscr{H} = H \cap \Sigma\). Since \(\mathfrak{H}^{\mu}(p)\) is past-pointing timelike at \(p\), for continuity we might deform \(\mathscr{H}\) outward in a neighborhood of \(p\) in \(\Sigma\), to obtain a \(2\)-surface \(\mathscr{H}'\) which intersects \(J^-(\mathscr{I}^+)\) non trivially, and such that is past pointing timelike for any point in the intersection \(\mathscr{H}' \cup J^-(\mathscr{I}^+)\).
	
	Call \(K\) the closed region in \(\Sigma\) between \(\mathscr{H}\) and \(\mathscr{H}'\), and pick a point \(q \in \mathscr{I}^+ \cup \partial J^+(K)\). Because of proposition \ref{prop:perp-critical-gamma} we know that the null geodesic generator of \(\partial J^+(K)\) must meet \(\mathscr{H}'\) orthogonally; however proposition \ref{cor:fp-criteria}, tells us that such generator must have a focal point within a finite value of the affine parameter, and thus gives a contradiction. Hence 
	\[
	\forall p \in H \quad \exists v^{\mu} \in T_pH^{\perp} \text{ causal and future directed, such that }  \mathfrak{H}^{\mu}(p)v_{\mu} \ge 0.
	\]
	In particular we can build a vector field \(V \in TH^{\perp}\) such that \(\mathfrak{H}^{\mu}(p)V_{\mu}(p) \ge 0\) everywhere on \(H\).
	Then, as proved in \cite{kriele1999spacetime} and reported in section \ref{sec:submanifolds}, we have that:
	\begin{equation*}
		\delta_VA_{\mathscr{H}_1} = \int_{\mathscr{H}_1} \mathfrak{H}^{\mu}(p)V_{\mu} \ge 0
	\end{equation*}
	when we modify \(\mathscr{H}_1\) along the flow of \(V\), or, in other words, the area of \(\mathscr{H}_1\) can never decrease.
\end{proof}
