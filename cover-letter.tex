\maketitle

My name is Veronica Sacchi, and I am currently a Master Physics student at the Scuola Normale Superiore and the University of Pisa. The former is an institution that offers a scholarship to few selected students, renewed on an annual basis, to allow them to develop their interests in several fields of knowledge in a demanding but very collaborative envirnment.
Having been an active part of it in the last \(4.5\) years has allowed me to live fully immersed in a particularly stimulating environment, and I enjoyed exploring many different topics with some incredibly lively interactions with very bright colleagues. I loved this fruitful cooperation, I found it incredibly stimulating and I'd be looking forward to keeping working in a similar environment.

I'd like to study for a research degree because I have always been fascinated by some fundamental questions about our universe and I think this is the best way to keep developing this deep interest.
Up to now I have been studying for a Physics degree (first Bachelor and now Master), and I found in Theoretical Physics and specifically in General Relativity a glimpse of the understanding I want to get about our world. 
I also find exciting the elegant and sometimes rather simple explanations Mathematical Physics has provided us with: the ability to single out the``few" key factors one needs to make so many precise and powerful deductions keeps leaving me astonished and I hope I will be able to contribute to the development of this amazing art in the future.
Specifically at the moment I am working on the Singularity Theorems for my Master thesis, but I've only just started to work on it and I plan to finish in the Summer.
Last year I also worked for about a month on Classical Singularity Theorems and you can find the slides of the talk I have given afterwards at this \href{https://uz.sns.it/~ver22albireo/ext-file/colloquio/slides.pdf}{link}.

Besides, I have been a former contestant in the EGMO (European Girls' Mathematical Olympiads): this is what got me involved into Mathematics at a more formal level, and after that I have always been very active in trying to promote STEM subjects among girls. I believe girls still have a lot of potential that needs to be developed, and I try to encourage many high school girls in joining me in a scientific career by organizing several stages and training specifically targeted to them.

Finally, I believe I have a very passionate personality, I am very curious and I love asking questions and discuss problems with friends and acquaintances. I might not be the brightest person you ever met, and it is not rare I have to ask a friend to explain again something to me, but I always try to do my best to keep up and the enthusiasm I contribute to inject into the work can usually spread around, making out of many challenging afternoons of work some lovely memories.
