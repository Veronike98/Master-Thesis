\section{Geodesics}\label{sec:geodesics}

The main source of inspiration for this first chapter is the book by B. O'Neill \cite{o1983semi}. We shall refer mainly to chapters \(10\) and \(14\); when needed, more specific references will be made.

Let's start off with some basic concepts derived from differential geometry. We will generally address the spacetime manifold as \(M\), \(g\) its Lorentzian metric and \(\nabla\) the Levi-Civita covariant derivative.
We will generally assume that a \emph{spacetime} is a smooth, time-oriented Lorentzian manifold; we will use the terms manifold and spacetime interchangeably, unless otherwise stated.
The first fundamental definition we need is:
\begin{definition}
	Let \((M, g)\) be a spacetime and \(I \subseteq \R\) an interval; a smooth curve \(\gamma : I \rightarrow M\) is a \emph{geodesic} if its tangent field is parallel transported along \(\gamma\).\\
\end{definition}    

%\EAK{Below you are talking about timelike geodesics, clarify it and mention that the parametrization is proper time}

Restricting to the case of timelike geodesics parameterized by proper time, we may call \(U\indices{^{\mu}} \coloneqq \dot{\gamma}^{\mu}\) the tangent field, and the previous definition is equivalent to the equation:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:tang-trans-fields}
\nabla_U U^{\mu} \coloneqq \frac{D\tensor{U}{^\mu} }{dt} \equiv 0.
\end{equation}



A \emph{curve} is a \(1\)-parameter map; similarly we can define a \emph{family of curves} as a \(2\)-parameter map \(\zeta: I \times J \rightarrow M\), where \(I, J \subseteq \R\) are intervals. This gives us \(2\) tangent fields, which we call respectively \emph{longitudinal} and \emph{transverse}:
\[
U^{\mu} \coloneqq \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \zeta^{\mu}(t,s); \quad \quad \quad 
V^{\mu} \coloneqq \frac{\partial}{\partial s} \zeta^{\mu}(t,s). 
\]

\begin{definition}
	Given a curve \(\gamma\), a \emph{(smooth) variation of \(\gamma\)} is any (smooth) \(2\)-parameter map \(\zeta(s,t)\) such that 
	\[
	\left. \zeta(s, t) \right\vert_{s = 0} = \gamma(t).
	\]
\end{definition}

%\EAK{Small comment: if the equation is at the end of a sentence we usually have a full stop at the end. }

\begin{remark}
	Commutation of partial derivatives immediately gives 
	\[
	[U, V] = 0 \implies \nabla_U V^{\mu} = \nabla_V U^{\mu}
	\]
	and, by definition of the Riemann tensor
	\[
	[\nabla_U, \nabla_V]W^{\mu} = R\indices{^{\mu}_{\nu\alpha\beta}}W^{\nu}U^{\alpha}V^{\beta}
	\].
\end{remark}

By this remark we can compute the second derivative of the transverse field:
\[
\frac{D^2\tensor{V}{^\mu} }{dt^2} = \nabla_U\nabla_V U^{\mu} = \nabla_V\nabla_U U^{\mu} + R\indices{^{\mu}_{\nu\alpha\beta}}U^{\nu}U^{\alpha}V^{\beta}
\]

which his leads us to the second fundamental object we need to define. 
\begin{definition}
	Given a family of \emph{geodesics} \(\gamma_s(t) \coloneqq \zeta(s,t)\), the transversal field \(V^{\mu} \coloneqq \frac{\partial}{\partial s} \zeta^{\mu}(t,s)\) is said to be a \emph{Jacobi field}.
\end{definition}

This vector field has a very important characterization, which here we'll only state:
\begin{lemma}
\(V^{\mu}\) is a \emph{Jacobi field} if and only if it satisfies the equation
	\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:Jacobi}
		\frac{D^2\tensor{V}{^\mu} }{dt^2} = \nabla_U\nabla_V U^{\mu} =  R\indices{^{\mu}_{\nu\alpha\beta}}U^{\nu}U^{\alpha}V^{\beta}.
	\end{equation}
\end{lemma}

Jacobi fields also have some nice properties we will find helpful in the prosecution of our work;
\begin{lemma}
	\label{lemma:Jacobi-fields-properties}
	Let \(V\) be a Jacobi field on \(\gamma\); then
	\[
	V \perp \gamma \iff \exists a\neq b \quad\vert\quad V\perp \gamma(a),\gamma(b) \iff \exists a \quad\vert\quad Y, Y' \perp \gamma(a).
	\]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	The proof is nearly straightforward from the characterization of Jacobi field and the symmetries of the Riemann tensor:
	\[
	\frac{d^2}{dt^2} (U^{\mu}V_{\mu}) = R_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}U^{\mu}U^{\nu}U^{\alpha}V^{\beta} = 0
	\]
	hence \(U^{\mu}V_{\mu} = As + B\), from which the result is immediate.
\end{proof}
%\EAK{The previous subsection seems the relevant one to also define focal points and index forms}

\section{Submanifolds}
\label{sec:submanifolds}

\begin{definition}
	Let \(M\) be a submanifold of the semi-Riemannian manifold \(\bar{M}\), and \(j:M\rightarrow\bar{M}\) the inclusion map. Then \(M\) is a \emph{semi-Riemannian submanifold} if the pullback of the metric tensor \(j^*(g)\) is a metric tensor on \(M\).
\end{definition}

This definition makes it clear that observers on the submanifold \(M\) agree on the notion of distance as if they were outside the submanifold. Nevertheless, observers within \(M\) see the world differently than observers from the outside: they in fact will inherit \(2\) different connections from their respective notion of metric. 

The comparison between these \(2\) different Levi-Civita connections gives surge to the \emph{second fundamental form}, which provides an infinitesimal description of the shape of \(M\) within \(\bar{M}\).

In order to introduce this important object notice first of all that:
\[
\forall p \in M \quad T_p\bar{M} = \underbrace{T_pM}_{\text{vectors tangent to }M}+ \underbrace{T_p(M)^{\perp}}_{\text{vectors orthogonal to } M}
\]

\noindent and we will generally call \(\Pi_p^{\parallel}\coloneqq d_pj\) and \(\Pi_p^{\perp}\coloneqq \mathbb{1} - d_pj\) the projective maps on these \(2\) subspaces.
Adopting a similar notation, we can decompose the set of all smooth fields in \(T\bar{M}\) restricted to \(M\) as:
\[
\bar{\mathfrak{X}}(M) = \mathfrak{X}(M) + \mathfrak{X}(M)^{\perp}.
\]

Now, the connection \(\bar{D}\) on \(\bar{M}\) will naturally give raise to a connection on \(M\)
\begin{align*}
\bar{D} : \mathfrak{X}(M) \times \bar{\mathfrak{X}}(M) & \rightarrow \bar{\mathfrak{X}}(M) \\
	 V \times X &\mapsto \bar{D}_V X
\end{align*}

by taking any smooth extension of the fields \(V\) and \(X\) to \(\mathfrak{X}(\bar{M})\), and then restricting again on \(M\). It can be proved that \(\bar{D}_V X\) is a well-defined smooth vector field on \(M\). In particular
\begin{lemma} 
	if \(V, W \in \mathfrak{X}(M)\) and \(D\) is the Levi-Civita connection on \(M\), it holds that
	\[
	D_V W = \Pi^{\parallel}\left(\bar{D}_V W\right).
	\]
\end{lemma}

It's evident then that the Levi-Civita connection on \(M\) is missing something with respect to the induced connection from \(\bar{M}\). This is precisely the object we have been looking for:

%\EAK{Math symbol for second fundamental form: $\mathrm{I\!I}$}
\begin{definition}
	given \(M \subset \bar{M}\) a semi-Riemannian submanifold, the \emph{shape tensor} (or \emph{second fundamental form}) is defined as:
	\begin{align*}
		\mathrm{I\!I} : \mathfrak{X}(M) \times \mathfrak{X}(M) &\longrightarrow \mathfrak{X}(M)^{\perp}\\
							V \times W &\mapsto \Pi^{\perp}\left(\bar{D}_V W\right)
	\end{align*}
	\noindent and in particular is bilinear and symmetric.
\end{definition}

In order to gain a better understanding of what this object encodes, let's think for a moment about the following example. Given a field \(Y \in \mathfrak{X}(M)\) tangent to a curve \(\alpha\) of \(M\), parameterized by \(s\), we indicate:
\[
\dot{Y} \coloneqq \frac{\bar{D}Y}{ds} \quad \quad Y' \coloneqq \frac{DY}{ds}
\]
It is then easy to prove that:
\[
\ddot{\alpha} = \alpha'' + \mathrm{I\!I}(\alpha', \alpha')
\]

and hence, we can think of \(\mathrm{I\!I}\) as the additional external ``force'' needed to keep a point moving on \(M \subset \bar{M}\), a sort of constraining force. An equivalent interpretation is by how much a vector paralleled transported in \(M\) according to \(D\) is actually changing from the point of view of \(\bar{D}\).

We now prove an identity which will be useful to remember in the future. First of all we need to define the analogous of Jacobi fields for variations of curves where one of the endpoints is a submanifold: the \(M\)-Jacobi fields.
\begin{definition}
	Given a submanifold \(M\) in \(\bar{M}\), a \(M\)-Jacobi field is the variation vector field of a geodesic \(\gamma \perp M\) through normal geodesics.
\end{definition}
\begin{lemma}
	\label{lemma:shape-identity}
	Let \(M\) be a submanifold of \(\bar{M}\), \(\gamma\) a curve leaving \(M\) orthogonally in \(p\), with tangent vector field \(U^{\mu}\), and \(e_1, \ldots, e_m\) a basis for the space of perpendicular \(M-\)Jacobi fields on \(\gamma\).
	Then 
	\begin{equation}
		(\Pi^{\parallel}\nabla_Ue_i)_{\mu}e_j^{\mu} = - \mathrm{I\!I}(e_i, e_j)^{\mu}U_{\mu}
	\end{equation}
\end{lemma}

	\begin{proof}
		As \(\gamma\) and its variations are orthogonal to \(M\) \(e_j^{\mu}U_{\mu} \equiv 0\), hence:
		\[
		0 = \nabla_{e_i}\left(e_j^{\mu}U_{\mu}\right) = \left(\nabla_{e_i}U_{\mu}\right)e_j^{\mu} + U_{\mu}\left(\nabla_{e_i}e_j^{\mu}\right)
		\]
		Again, \(U_{\mu}\) is orthogonal to \(M\), then \(U_{\mu}  \left(\nabla_{e_i}e_j^{\mu}\right)= U_{\mu}\left(\Pi^{\perp}\nabla_{e_i}e_j^{\mu}\right)\), while \(e_i\) is a Jacobi field so \(\nabla_{e_i}U^{\mu} = \nabla_Ue_i^{\mu}\). Plugging this back into the previous equation we get exactly
		\[
		(\Pi^{\parallel}\nabla_Ue_i)_{\mu}e_j^{\mu} = (\nabla_Ue_i)_{\mu}e_j^{\mu} = (\nabla_{e_i}U)_{\mu} e_j^{\mu} = - U_{\mu}\left(\Pi^{\perp}\nabla_{e_i}e_j^{\mu}\right) = - \mathrm{I\!I}(e_i, e_j)^{\mu}U_{\mu}
		\]
	\end{proof}


The second fundamental form induces a vector field on \(M\) called \emph{mean curvature}.


\begin{definition}
		Let\(M \subset \bar{M}\) be an  \(n\)-semi-Riemannian submanifold, with \emph{shape tensor} \(\mathrm{I\!I}\), and \(\{\textbf{e}_i\}_{i \in \{1, \ldots, n\}}\) any frame on \(M\) at \(p\). Then we call \emph{mean curvature vector field} the field \(\mathrm{H} \in \mathfrak{X}(M)^{\perp} \) defined by:
		\[
		\mathfrak{H}^{\mu}(p) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \epsilon_i \mathrm{I\!I}^{\mu}(\textbf{e}_i, \textbf{e}_i).
		\]
		where 
		\[
		\epsilon_i = 
		\begin{cases}
		+1 \quad \text{if } \textbf{e}_i \text{ is \emph{timelike}} \\
		-1 \quad \text{if } \textbf{e}_i \text{ is \emph{spacelike}}
		\end{cases}
		\]
\end{definition}

This definition will be particularly important for the proof of Null Singularity Theorems, as they are instrumental to define the concept of a \emph{trapped surface}, the initial condition needed to eventually develop a singularity (in the classical limit). 

Finally, let us prove a quick lemma that will be useful here and there throughout the all analysis of the thesis.
\begin{lemma}
	\label{lemma:metric-decomposition}
	Let \(P\) be a spacelike hypersurface of codimension \(2\) and \(\gamma_s\) a congruence of null geodesics leaving normally from \(P\); call \(U^{\mu}\) the (null) tangent vector field and \(\{e_i^{\mu}\}_{i = 1, \ldots, n - 1}\) an orthonormal basis of the tangent space to \(P\). Finally, parallel transport \(\{e_i^{\mu}\}_{i = 1, \ldots, n - 2}\) along \(\gamma\) in order to gain \(n - 2\) vector fields \(\{E_i^{\mu}\}_{i = 1, \ldots, n - 2}\). Then there exists a null vector field \(W^{\mu}\) such that the metric can be decomposed as
	\begin{equation}
		g^{\mu\alpha} = U^{\mu}W^{\alpha} + U^{\alpha}W^{\mu} - \sum_{i=1}^{n - 2}E_i^{\mu}E_i^{\alpha}.
	\end{equation}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	This is only a linear algebra exercise, which basically reduces to decompose the metric tensor on \(T_{\gamma_0}M = T_{\gamma(0)}P \oplus T_{\gamma(0)}P^{\perp}\). By definition \(\{E_i^{\mu}\}_{i = 1, \ldots, n - 2}\) is an orthonormal basis of \(T_{\gamma(0)}P\), so we are left with the decomposition on \(T_{\gamma(0)}P^{\perp}\), whose dimension is \(2\) by hypothesis.
	We already know that a good vector in \(T_{\gamma(0)}P^{\perp}\) is \(U^{\mu}\) and that the signature is \((+, -)\), then there must be another null vector \(W^{\mu}\) such that \(W^{\mu}U_{\mu} = 1\) (we can think about \(\R^{1,1}\) as it's always possible to reduce to that for the tangent space of a single point). Now we have found a basis of \(T_{\gamma_0}M\), and it's easy to show that for any \(2\) vectors \(a\) and \(b\) we can decompose them in terms of this new basis, compute their inner product using both formulations of \(g\), and check they are equal.
\end{proof}

\section{Trapped surfaces}

\begin{definition}
	\label{def:trapped-surface}
	We say that a spacelike submanifold \(P\) is \emph{future-converging} or \emph{future-trapped} provided its mean curvature vector field \(\mathrm{H}\) is past-pointing timelike.
\end{definition}


It is only a matter of simple linear algebra in each normal space \(T_p(P)^{\perp}\) to show that
\begin{lemma} \label{lemma:charact-trapped}
	assuming \(P\) is a \emph{spacelike} submanifold, the following statements are equivalent:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item  \(k(v) =\mathrm{H}^{\mu} v_{\nu} < 0 \) for all future pointing \emph{null} vectors \(v\) normal to P.
		\item  \(k(w) =\mathrm{H}^{\mu} w_{\nu} < 0 \) for all future pointing \emph{causal} vectors \(w\) normal to P.
		\item \(\mathrm{H}\) is past-pointing timelike.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	We will prove a chain of implications to gain the equivalence.
	
	\(\mathbf{2) \implies 1)]}\) this is trivial because any null vector is a causal vector.
	
	\(\mathbf{1) \implies 3)]}\) Let's write \(\mathrm{H}^{\mu} = (\mathrm{H}^0, \vec{\mathrm{H}})\). It is possible to choose a spacelike \(3-\)vector \(\vec{v}\) such that \(\vert\vec{v}\cdot\vec{\mathrm{H}}\vert = - \vert\vec{v}\vert\cdot\vert\vec{\mathrm{H}}\vert\) and  then complete it to the future-pointing null vector \(v^{\mu} = (v^0, \vec{v})\) (where \(v^0 = \vert \vec{v}\vert > 0\)).
	Now:
	\[
	\mathrm{H}^{\mu}v_{\mu} = \mathrm{H}^0v^0 - \vec{\mathrm{H}}\cdot\vec{v} < 0 \quad \implies 
	\quad v^0 \mathrm{H}^0 < - \vert\vec{v}\vert\cdot\vert\vec{\mathrm{H}}\vert < 0
	\]
	which, for the positivity of \(v^0\), implies that \(H^{\mu}\) is timelike and past-pointing.
	
	\(\mathbf{3) \implies 2)]}\) first of all observe that any causal vector can be written as the sum of \(2\) future-pointing vectors such that \(w^{\mu}= v^{\mu} + t^{\mu}\) where \(v\) is null, and \(t^{\mu} = (t^0, \vec{0})\) (with \(t^0 \ge 0\)). At this point:
	\[
	w_{\mu}\mathrm{H}^{\mu} = v_{\mu}\mathrm{H}^{\mu} + \underbrace{t^0 \mathrm{H}^0}_{\le0}
	\]
	Moreover, by Cauchy-Schwartz we have:
	\[
	v_{\mu}\mathrm{H}^{\mu} = v^0 \mathrm{H}^0 - \vec{\mathrm{H}}\cdot\vec{v} \le v^0\mathrm{H}^0 +\vert \vec{\mathrm{H}}\vert\cdot\underbrace{\vert\vec{v}\vert}_{v^0} = v^0\underbrace{(\mathrm{H}^0 + \vert \vec{\mathrm{H}}\vert)}_{<0} < 0.
	\]
\end{proof}

However, the one stated above \ref{def:trapped-surface} is not the definition that has been in use from the beginning of the analysis of these objects. The most widely used definition is by far the one that passes through the definition of expansion: we will now state this definition for codimension \(2\) spacelike submanifolds, and making use of the \emph{null} expansion, but the same idea can be generalized to a much larger class of submanifolds. Consider the spacelike codimension \(2\) submanifold \(P\subset M\), and the congruence of \emph{null} geodesics leaving normally from \(P\); call \(U^{\mu}\) the tangent field.

Of course there are \(2\) such congruences: we will call \emph{positive} congruence one of them, and \emph{negative} the other one, whose tangent field - except for riparametrization - will be \(W^{\mu}\). By lemma \ref{lemma:metric-decomposition} we can decompose the metric as 
\[
g^{\mu\alpha} = U^{\mu}W^{\alpha} + U^{\alpha}W^{\mu} - \sum_{i=1}^{n - 2}E_i^{\mu}E_i^{\alpha}.
\]
Moreover,
\begin{definition}
	 Consider the tensor field given by the gradient of the tangent field:
	\[
	B_{\mu\nu} = \nabla_{\nu}U_{\mu}.
	\]
	The trace of \(B_{\mu\nu}\) is going to be called \emph{positive null expansion}:
	\[
	\theta^{+} = \texttt{tr}\left[B\right] = g^{\mu\nu}B_{\mu\nu}.
	\]
	Similarly, if we chose the negative congruence we would have had
	\[
	\tilde{B}_{\mu\nu} = \nabla_{\nu}W_{\mu}.
	\]
	and its trace is defined as the \emph{negative null expansion}
	\[
	\theta^{-} = \texttt{tr}\left[\tilde{B}\right] = g^{\mu\nu}\tilde{B}_{\mu\nu}.
	\]
\end{definition}

It's clear that for any point of the submanifold we are able to compute the positive and the negative expansion; this finally leads to the definition of trapped surface
\begin{definition}
	A codimension \(2\) spacelike hypersurface is called \emph{trapped} if both its positive and negative expansions are negative
	\[
	\theta^+ , \theta^- < 0.
	\]
\end{definition}

We finally want to prove that the \(2\) definitions are indeed equivalent.
\begin{lemma}
	\label{lemma:equiv-trapped}
	The \(2\) definitions of trapped surface are equivalent.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Let us use the same notation introduced above, for which \(P\) is the hypersurface under consideration, \(\{E_i^{\mu}\}_{i = 1, \ldots, n - 2}\) is an orthonormal basis of its tangent space, \(U^{\mu}\) and \(W^{\mu}\) \(2\) orthogonal null vectors such that \(U^{\mu}W_{\mu} = 1\) tangent to the respective orthogonal null congruences. As \(U^{\mu}\) is null and parallel transported we have
	\begin{align*}
		\theta^+ &= g^{\mu\nu}B_{\mu\nu} = \left(g^{\mu\nu} - U^{\mu}W^{\nu} - U^{\nu}W^{\mu}\right)B_{\mu\nu} =\\
		&= - \sum_{i=1}^{n - 2}E_i^{\mu}E_i^{\nu}B_{\mu\nu} = - \sum_{i=1}^{n - 2}E_i^{\mu}E_i^{\nu}\nabla_{\nu}U_{\mu} = \\
		& = -  \sum_{i=1}^{n - 2}E_i^{\nu}\nabla_{\nu}\underbrace{\left(E_i^{\mu}U_{\mu}\right)}_{0} +  \sum_{i=1}^{n - 2}U_{\mu}E_i^{\nu}\nabla_{\nu}E_i^{\mu} = \sum_{i=1}^{n - 2}U_{\mu}\nabla_{E_i}E_i^{\mu} = \\
		& = (n - 2) U_{\mu} \cdot \frac{1}{n - 2}\sum_{i=1}^{n - 2}\mathrm{I\!I}^{\mu} \left(E_i, E_i\right) = (n - 2) U_{\mu}\mathrm{H}^{\mu}.
	\end{align*}
	Similarly
	\[
	\theta^- = (n - 2) W_{\mu}\mathrm{H}^{\mu}.
	\]
	As \(P\) has codimension \(2\), \(U^{\mu}\) and \(W^{\mu}\) are the only independent null vectors orthogonal to \(P\), and then, by means of lemma \ref{lemma:charact-trapped}, we know that 
	\[
	\theta^+ , \theta^- < 0 \iff \mathrm{H}^{\mu} \text{ is past-pointing timelike,}
	\]
	establishing the equivalence between the \(2\) definitions.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
	It's worth pointing out that, as Wald states in section \(9.2\) of \cite{wald2010general} about the expansion of a null congruence of geodesics, there is no natural way to directly compute \(\theta\), as we have done above. The point is that we didn't have only the congruence, but also a submanifold \(P\) to which the congruence is orthogonal, and that indeed infers a natural basis with which is possible to compute \(\theta\). Given only the congruence instead, there are infinitely many possible spacelike submanifolds orthogonal to it, as one can see by studying the system in \(R^{2,1}\).

Even if we already have \(2\) good definitions of \emph{trapped} surface, they are both rather mathematical, while we would like to develop a better intuition of the features of these objects. The most outstanding property is described by the following lemma; we report the statement given in \cite{senovilla2022critical}. A proof for hypersurfaces of codimension \(1\) can be found in \cite{kriele1999spacetime} as Lemma \(4.4.8\), and can be generalized to submanifolds of any dimension, but we don't report the proof here.
\VS{Should I write the proof of this fact here?}
\begin{lemma}
	\label{lemma:variation-area}
	Let \(P\) be any spacelike subnaifold of any dimension, and denote as \(A_P\) its area. Then choose an arbitrary vector field \(\xi^{\mu}\): this will induce a flow \(F_t\), and \(P\) can be deformes along this flow. The initial variation of the area due to this deformation is
	\[
	\delta_{\xi}A_P = \int_{P} \texttt{div}_P (\Pi^{\parallel}\xi) + \mathrm{H}^{\mu}\xi_{\mu}.
	\]
\end{lemma}
 Clearly, if \(P\) is without boundary the first term integrates out for Stokes theorem (\(\texttt{div}_P\) is the divergence of \(P\)), and we are left with
 \begin{equation}
 	\label{eq:variation-area}
 	\delta_{\xi}A_P = \int_{P} \mathrm{H}^{\mu}\xi_{\mu}.
 \end{equation}
	This equation is telling us that \(P\) is trapped if and only if its area is doomed to decrease, no matter how they evolve (as long as they keep causality). In this sense they are trapped, or rather, \emph{trapping}, because everything they contain will be surrounded by a submanifold of less and less area... Until some catastrohe might occur!

\section{Causality conditions}

The notion of \emph{causality} has to do with the fact that in a Lorentzian manifold, starting from a  point \(p\) it is not true that an observer or a light ray can travel to any other point \(q\), as they are allowed only to move along (future pointing) causal geodesics (i.e. whose tangent field is never spacelike).


\EAK{Why $\guillemotleft$ and not $\ll$? Similarly why $\prec$ and not $<$?}
We will denote causality relations with the following notation, following \cite{o1983semi}.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item  \(p \guillemotleft q\) means there is a future-pointing \emph{timelike} curve in \(M\) connecting \(p\) to \(q\).
	\item \(p \prec q\) means there is a future-pointing \emph{causal} curve from \(p\) to \(q\).
\end{enumerate}

Evidently \(p\guillemotleft q\) implies \(p\prec q\) but not vice versa. For a subset \(A \subseteq M\) we also define:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item the \emph{chronological future} of \(A\)
	\[
	I^+(A) =\{ q\in M :\quad\exists p \in A\text{ with } p\guillemotleft q\}.
	\]
	\item the \emph{causal future} of \(A\)
	\[
	I^+(A) =\{ q\in M : \quad\exists p \in A\text{ with } p\prec q\}.
	\]
\end{enumerate}
\EAK{Might want to add the domain of dependence, Cauchy horizon, spatial/timelike/null infinities we discussed last time (also look at Wald). A conformal diagram might be nice too (something to think about later perhaps).}
