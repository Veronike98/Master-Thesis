Penrose Singularity Theorem....

\begin{remark}
    Notice that the bound on the initial condition required for any singularity theorem is exactly complementary to the one set by the area theorem, as they are based on the same property of the functional \(J[f]\).

    In particular then, whatever surface used as initial condition for a singularity theorem will have to be entirely contained within the black hole horizion.
    This is actually a generalization of proposition \(12.2.3\) of \cite{wald2010general} to weaker energy conditions.
\end{remark}
